# Thumbmark: Visual Bookmark & Screenshot Organizer

Thumbmark is a browser extension that helps you save and organize web content visually. [cite_start]Unlike traditional bookmarks that are just text links, Thumbmark captures a screenshot and location of the page, providing instant visual context so you can quickly find and remember what you saved[cite: 37, 41].

## Features

### One-Click Capture
[cite_start]Capture a screenshot of the **visible portion** of a webpage with a single click of the extension icon[cite: 5, 6]. [cite_start]The extension also automatically grabs the page's URL, location and title[cite: 7].

### Visual Gallery
[cite_start]Your saved bookmarks are displayed in a clean gallery view, represented by their screenshot thumbnails and titles[cite: 23, 24]. [cite_start]Clicking on a bookmark opens the original URL in a new tab at the saved location[cite: 25].

### Smart Organization
[cite_start]Add notes and tags to your bookmarks to add essential context and make them more useful than just an image[cite: 18]. [cite_start]The flexible tagging system allows for easier categorization than rigid, folder-based systems[cite: 45].

### Quick Search
[cite_start]Easily find a specific bookmark using the built-in search bar, which filters by title, notes, or tags as you type[cite: 28].

### Portable HTML Export(coming soon)
[cite_start]Generate a single HTML file containing all of your saved bookmarks[cite: 31]. [cite_start]This self-contained file can be opened in any browser, giving you full control and portability of your curated content[cite: 52, 53].

## Problems Solved

* [cite_start]**The "Bookmark Void"**: Traditional text-based bookmarks often lack context, making it hard to remember why you saved a page[cite: 38, 39]. [cite_start]Thumbmark's visual bookmarks provide instant recall[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]**Information Overload**: It can be challenging to organize information with standard folder systems, leading to messy lists[cite: 44]. [cite_start]Thumbmark's visual representation and flexible tagging make organization intuitive[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]**Inefficient Retrieval**: Scrolling through hundreds or thousands of text links can be slow[cite: 47]. [cite_start]Visual cues combined with quick search make finding what you need faster and easier[cite: 48, 49].
* [cite_start]**Lack of Portability**: Bookmarks can be locked into your browser's ecosystem, making them difficult to share or back up[cite: 51]. [cite_start]The HTML export feature gives you a shareable and self-contained backup of your data[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**"Death by a Thousand Tabs"**: Keeping tabs open as a form of bookmarking can slow down your browser[cite: 55]. [cite_start]Thumbmark provides an efficient way to store pages without keeping them as active tabs, improving performance and productivity[cite: 56].
